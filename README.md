# CMPSC 100: Computational Expression

Greetings from `term-world`! Right now, it's a bit...em...barren. But! I promise that it once teemed with digital life and, uh, that's where _you_ come in. Together, we'll restore `term-world` to tbe bustling metropolis it was meant to be! (Which, of course it _totally was_ at one time; it's not like I'm using you for free labor or anything like that—you're just, like, not _paid_.)

This resource contains the rules that we need to agree to in order to make that happen, so have a read. (It's actually really important.)

A lot of our time will be dedicated to...building! In fact, nearly all of it appears to be allocated that way. That this is true _doesn't_ mean that these sessions are things to skip. Each of these meetings will feature significant support either via community Technical Leaders, the Mayor themself, or your fellow neighborhood members. 

Many folks often find that time dedicated to completing this work during the week offers the right mix of help and fellowship that make the labor palatable. (Plus, the Mayor doesn't like to be lonely.)

### Canonical course description

> An introduction to the principles of computer science with an emphasis on creative expression through the medium of a programming language. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students learn the computational structures needed to solve problems and produce artifacts such as interactive games and computer-mediated art and music.  Students also learn how to organize and document a program's source code so that it effectively communicates with the intended users and maintainers. Additionally, the introduction includes an overview of the discipline of computer science and computational thinking.  During a weekly laboratory session students use state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written reports and oral presentations.

* Prerequisite knowledge: Elementary algebra
* Distribution requirements: `ME`,`SP`

### Less canonical, but still official, course description

Some interpretations of the subject treat "computer science" as a kind of sacrosanct technical knowledge. And that is somewhat true: to some, it serves as a characterization of how skills learned as part of how the discipline is exercised in service of implementing or achieving a technical goal. There are certainly technical constructs that programmers have to obey and rules that, while somewhat pliable, are relatively inflexible. Undoubtedly, you'll encounter frustration in this course with conventions arising from technical agreements which may seem arbitrary.

The above description of the discipline does it little service and neglects to contemplate the kinds of procrustean, dictatorial constructs that those with the ability to create systems (i.e. ability to "code") can force socities to struggle under. Rather than letting technical requirements impose themselves on you, this course is meant to impart the skills to ask productive questions about _how_ and _why_ we might structure a world a particular way. In some cases—as we'll see later in the course—these questions provide more than just an intellectual exercise: there are troubling real-world implications of the ways that computer science has been and will be used both in- and outside this classroom. From data breaches to threats to identity, we've all experienced these forces and the toll they take on our lives.

By the end of the course, our hope is that this awareness and (hopefully) the desire to build a better world emerge. Learning the literacy of computer code gives you a valuable power. It's our goal to figure out how to use it wisely in the larger world. What better way than to _build one_?

### Required materials

#### Textbook(s)

There are no textbooks for this course. Any texts or articles used will be available online or distributed by the instructor.

#### Platforms

This course relies on the [GitHub](https://www.github.com), Discord, YouTube, and [`term-world`](https://world.theterm.world) platforms. Your work will be assigned and evaluated using these platforms and official course communication will take place through them. You are expected to sign up for accounts and remain active on these platforms throughout the semester.

##### A note on use of class platforms

These platforms are for our use only. To use them, you'll need to register and be logged into accounts associated with your Allegheny College email. Moreover, by remaining enrolled in this class, you agree _not_ to share these resources with anyone _outside of_ our course.

This provision, while seemingly minor, is extremely important in making sure that our course community stays a healthy one.

#### Media

Before each week begins, I will assign a group of short, topic-focused videos to review. These videos may contain activities that you can do in parallel with or after watching material. Video content is meant to support, but not substitute for, topics discussed and exercised that week. I will provide links to participate in or to access activities or supplmentary material in a Slack post along with video links.

### Learning objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

* Develop and realize moderately complex ideas and their effects in a digital medium
* Understand the basic language-independent principles of "object-oriented programming" (OOP)
* Express basic fluency in the Python programming language
* Exercise an intermediate grasp of industry-standard tools used to build software (e.g GitHub, IDEs)
* Learn to adapt to the important, but often accidental, aspects of writing code
* Demonstrate the ability to communicate, plan, and collaborate as an integral part of the creative and civic process

### Governance and evaluation

This course's evaluation, participation and, eventually, grades, are governed by the [Course Contract](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

This, however, does not abrogate the role of this syllabus document. Provisions here work together with the contract. You should consider the information provided here the basic "givens" of the course.

#### Assignments

All course assignments are assigned and evaluated using the GitHub platform. I will only assess work correctly deposited there. While we use our course Jupyter for _doing_ the work, the final versions _must_ be on GitHub. Though the previous set of statements implies the following, I state it explicitly here to avoid misunderstanding: I _will not_ grade work left on the `term-world` server. In fact, _I can't_.

##### Reflections

You will be asked at various points to reflect on ways you can connect your work to general course concepts or to understanding your progress in the course as a whole.

When reflections are assigned, they will be accompanied with a prompt. All reflections should be added to the dedicated reflections repository that we will `clone` in the opening sessions of the course.

##### Course project

This project offers students the opportunity to develop a realized version of an reasonably complex student-created project. Completion of this project will require use of the knowledge accumulated throughout the semester. Details for this project will be given out at the approximate mid-point of the semester. This task will require planning, careful evaluation, and implementation of a wide variety of concepts, and will allow students to choose and implement a project of their chosen discipline/application and approaches/methods. This project will be subject to approval by the instructor through a process including a formal proposal, interim updates, and technical reports.

### Course preparation

I expect students to arrive to class prepared. Here, "prepared" means having completed reading assignments, compiled questions, and being ready to engage thoughtfully with course material. In order to assist students' preparedness efforts, I will provide a [schedule](https://chompe.rs/fall-2022-100-schedule) with assignments and will accompany all videos with a copy of any slides used in class proceedings or recorded media.

### Allegheny College Statement of Community

Allegheny College also expects students and faculty to act according to its Statement of Community:

> Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms. This statement does not replace existing personnel policies and codes of conduct.

Keep both of these standards in mind as you exercise your academic inquiry in this course. These serve as our fundamental "first principles" in pursuit of our shared academic goals.

### Honor Code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code. Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment. Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and fellow students.  Such dialogue is encouraged.  However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else’s work.  It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of Computer Science are to be the original work of the student submitting the assignment, and should be signed in accordance with the provisions of the Honor Code.  Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the _Compass_.

The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as Stack Overflow, et al.

### Classroom ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to act according to discipline-specific ethics. I encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Seeking assistance

#### Assistance with course concepts

Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to seek assistance from the course instructor and teaching assistants. To meet with me, consult my available office hours (above) and make an appointment.

Historically, students who are successful in my courses visit and discuss course concepts with the instructor and Technical Leaders early and often. See [above for my office hours](#office-hours) or go to [this schedule for Technical Leaders' office hours](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/teaching/technicalleaders/).

#### Assistance outside of the course

If you find yourself in difficult circumstances which affect your ability to participate in or complete course work, let me know immediately. Full stop.

Do not wait until the end of the semester. 

Part of my role as a course instructor is to make sure that students receive the assistance they need. Do not hesitate to let me know if there is anything I can do with respect to your ability to handle your work. This is especially true of our current circumstances. Again, let me remind you -- __**it is part of my job**__ to help you access Allegheny College resources that will enable your safety and success.

In many situations, the following list of resources may help:

* [The Maytum Learning Commons](https://sites.allegheny.edu/learningcommons/)
* [Allegheny College Counseling Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/learningcommons/)
* [The Winslow Health Center](https://sites.allegheny.edu/healthcenter/)
* [Student Life](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentlife/)

### Special needs and disability
