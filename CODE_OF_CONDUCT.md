# CMPSC 100: Course Contract

## A word from the Mayor

We're building a world. That task shouldn't be taken on as a solitary or light burden. In many ways, the product of such an endeavor always means to be imperfect; we learn more as we _do_, and that process is rarely (i.e. never) linear or "clean." We benefit from being able to be a bit messy. You may intuit from this statement that we mean to engage with _process_ much more than _product_, though the latter is necessary. Following the various processes of `term-world` closely should yield a successful product; however, production of output is only the _basic_ expectation of the work we'll complete together.

That's why this community is evaluated on a _contract basis_, the terms of which are spelled out here. This document specifies your responsibilities and how that work will be rewarded. We're able to substantially alter the terms of this deal (see [the "Rules Rule"](#the-rules-rule) below), though we don't do so without participation in course governance.

## Contract stipulations

### The Basic Grade

(To qualify for this tier, all basic assignment objectives must be completely met.)

* All citizens who meet the covenants of this contract will earn an individual letter grade of `C` in this course

You may ask: why the basic grade is a `C` and not a `B` or `B-`? Rising to the level of above-average or exceptional work relies on the just that -- above-average or exceptional work. Merely completing the assignments maintains a kind of _status quo_. As our interest centers on making a _better_ world, this contract should provide incentive to think beyond mere sufficiency. As you'll see below, work that aspires to higher levels of reward involves doing the work of planning and (better yet) _making_ improvements.

### The `A` tier

(To qualify for this tier, all basic assignment objectives must be completely met.)

Citizens who take the opportunity to both provide _and_ implement substantive improvements to assignment content qualify for this contract tier. In order to qualify for this tier, citizens must:

* propose an assignment-related world improvment in each week's repository using the `Improvement Proposal` Issue template on GitHub which:
  * completes all document prompts
  * must be done by start of a lab session (Friday) of a given week
  * must be approved _in writing_ by the Mayor by the end of the lab session
    * the Office of the Mayor will provide suggestions in response
  * must either incorporate or provide rationale for _not_ incorporating suggestions from the Mayor's Office
    * this work is due by the assignment deadline (Sunday of each week)
* implement the improvement proposed by the assignment deadline

These proposals may be revisions to existing content or creation of wholly new content. In many cases, executing planned improvements will require some consultation with either community Technical Leaders _or_ the Mayor. Citizens wishing to achieve this tier should expect to avail themselves of the resources available, including office hours and other forms of correspondence.

Proposals and improvements must be completed for all weeks unless a week's content specifies otherwise in the accompanying assignment `README`. 

#### `A-` grades

Citizens who do not meet the above requirements for two (2) weeks will be awarded a mark of `A-` if all other weeks contain a proposal and subsequent improvement(s).

### The `B` tier

(To qualify for this tier, all basic assignment objectives must be completely met.)

Citizens who take the opportunity to both provide substantive improvements to assignment content qualify for this contract tier. In order to qualify for this tier, citizens must:

* propose an assignment-related world improvment in each week's repository using the `Improvement Proposal` Issue template on GitHub which:
  * completes all document prompts
  * must be finished by the start of a lab session (Friday) of a given week
  * must be recognized _in writing_ by the Mayor by the end of the lab session
  * must either incorporate or provide rationale for _not_ incorporating suggested revisions
    * this work is due by the assignment deadline (Sunday of each week)

These proposals may be revisions to existing content or creation of wholly new content. Proposals must be completed for all weeks unless a week's content specifies otherwise in the accompanying assignment `README`. 

#### `B+` grades

Citizens who both _propose and implement_ at least two (2) ideas will be awarded a mark of `B+` if all other weeks contain a proposal.

#### `B-` grades

Citizens who miss (2) proposals will be awarded a mark of `B-` if all other weeks contain them.

### The `C` Tier

(To qualify for this tier, all basic assignment objectives must be completely met.)

As per the [the Basic Grade rule](#the-basic-grade), meeting 100% of a given assignment's objectives constitutes earning a `C` mark.

#### `C+` grades

Citizens who _propose_ at least (2) ideas will be awarded a mark of `C+`, given that all grading checks are met for all other weeks.

### Grades lower than the Basic Grade

There are three (3) instances that penalize evaluation:

1. Incomplete assignments (i.e. basic expectations are not fulfilled)
2. Ignored assignments (i.e. not completed at all)
3. Plagiarism or other inappropriate/dishonest academic behavior

Each of these circumstances affects grades differently.

##### Note about assignment completion

This agreement operates on the understanding that circumstances may arise which interfere with completing assignments on time. Should a citizen need more time to complete work, they should file an issue on the repository containing the work which will be late.

#### Incomplete assignments

For every two (2) incomplete assignments, a citizen's course grade will be lowered by half a letter grade (e.g. _two_ (2) incomplete assignments would result in a mark of `C-`, et al.).

#### Ignored assignments

If a citizen misses _any_ assignment, their course grade is lowered by a half letter grade for each (e.g. _one_ (1) assignment missed would result in a `C-`, et al.).

#### Academic dishonesty

Citizens engaging in academically dishonest behavior will be assessed on a case-by-case basis, as circumstances and factors of a case vary widely. However, in situations where academic dishonesty is established, the variety of penalties might include (but are not limited to):

* disqualification from the `A` and/or `B` "tiers"
* an automatic assessment of an "Ignored" assignment

In severe cases, academic dishonesty may be referred to the supranational Alleghey College Honor Code Committee though these cases are rare (i.e. _almost_ non-existent). For questions of what qualitfies under the provision of "academic dishonesty" see the remainder of this document and the _Compass_.

The rules, regulations, and consequences inherent in the Allegheny College process are located in the [Allegheny College Honor Code](http://catalog.allegheny.edu/content.php?catoid=43&navoid=1510).

### Assignment "bugs" and impact on grading

* In the event that there are "bugs" with grader criteria, Mayor will assess completion status with known issues in mind
  * The Mayor will make every effort to remedy the failing check before the assignment due date
  * However, if during assignment evaluation, a check fails for every citizen due to a technical issue, the check is considered an invalid grading criteria 

#### Bug bounty

To mitigate future issues the Mayor has instituted a bug bounty. This is a way for you, the citizens, to surface issues with the world. 

* `TODO`: Determine required information and report format
  
### The "Rules Rule"

* Convenants in this contract may be changed following:
  * a successful "Pull Request" made on this document _and_
  * an open course discussion about the proposed change(s)
* Any changes will then be put to a vote
  * If a vote succeeds with a two-thirds majority (66%) outcome supporting the measure(s) proposed, the change will be made 

* The above applies to all portions of the contract _except_ for the "Basic Grade" and this rule ("Rules Rule")
* The Mayor reserves the following rights:
  * the right to veto a proposed change if
    * the change substantively alters the academic or course community integrity, _or_ 
    * a rule is superseded via policies governed by the College's academic standards or handbook
  * the right make unilateral changes that that uphold academic and community integrity

### Participation

For the duration of this course, take "participation" to mean some combination of:

* helping in group activities
* completing assignments
* Listens to class instruction
* Giving full effort to class activities
* Actively contributing to collaborative assignments
* Being prepared for class by completing work outside of class hours
* For group assignments, each member of the group should appear in the "Contributors" list
* Respect neighborhood members' working hours
  * If a member prefers not to work past 9:00p, recognize that their participation and time may be limited to a certain window each day and that this window may not always be the same
  * However, make your best effort to be available to peers in your neighborhood rather than setting extremely restrictive hours

Please note that none of the above definitions _requires verbal contribution_ -- while this is a _way_ to participate, it is not the _only_ way. Activity on GitHub may also constitute full participation, if efforts display the above qualities. Occasionally, for group assignments, your neighborhood may receive a level of effort survey to gauge peer appraisal of team contribution as well.

As several of you note in your suggestions for this contract, it is good practice to consider your participation not only necessary for _your own success_, but _required for the success of your neighborhood as a whole_.

#### Communicating in your neighborhoods

The Office of the Mayor expects neighborhoods to use their GitHub neighborhood pages to coordinate working hours on desired platforms 

#### Course platforms

On course platforms used for the duration of the semester:

* Use all platforms for appropiate class reasons 
* Follow the instructions while using the platforms
* Keeping "up-to-date" with platforms may require seeking additional extra-curricular knowledge
  * For example, using Markdown in Discord
* Respect others' thoughts, time, and contributions to either discussion or code product
* Check course platforms often -- at least twice a day
  * The best times to review are often the beginning and ends of a day
    * i.e.: 8:00 (beginning), 18:00 (end)

In addition, I suggest that you at least download and install the Discord application, rather than use the web interface. This is not required, but will help greatly with your ability to keep up with notifications.

#### Using office hours

When using office hours:

* Come in prepared with questions, a topic, or a clear objective
  * To achieve this, please add notes about expected topic(s) to a Google Calendar slot reservation (for instructor calendar)
* Be prepared to receive feedback, understanding that typically this means completing revisions on what ever you are working on
* Respect the time of other citizens (i.e. be mannerly and quick)
* Have all assignments ready to discuss with the Professor
* Not rely only on office hours (i.e. work should be attempted first)
 
#### Attendance

Especially in precarious times like those in which we find ourselves, I _cannot_ and _will not_ require you to be physically present for class sessions. However, if you feel well and comfortable, I (and your peers) ask that you attend class.

As many of your note, this isn't something that I provide grading criteria for. I don't really have an interest in directly grading attendance. However, _not attending_ traditionally shows up in final products and, thereby, grades. It's important to remember that attendance and participation are closely related. Not doing either severely restricts your ability to succeed in the course.

It is, however, also possible that a citizen many not feel well enough to attend even a portion of a remote course. In these situations, citizens must:

* Use their neighborhood as a source of knowledge for given content missed
* Failing the neighborhood's ability to "crowd-source" an answer, citizens should [use office hours](#Using-office-hours) to make up the gap in understanding
  * These hours _must be_ with the Mayor, and not a TL if intending to "catch up" on missed work
  * citizens who have missed a class may use TL office hour time to if they feel that they understand the content, but have questions about approach or methods       

### Neighborhood contributions

This course works due to the trust the Mayor places in each neighborhood becoming a collaborative home for all citizens. However, there is a fine line between collaboration and academic dishonesty. Here, we define that that line is and what general consequences (positive or negative) are under it.

As a rule, some assignments are _group assignments_, and expect a single neighborhood-built product. This is both collaborative and co-creative. 

Every assignment, however, is collaborative, meaning that you have unlimited access to the members of your neighborhood for insight and advice.

Both of the above assignment types operate on the assumption that members, instead of just sharing code and working solutions:

* Share tips and tricks
* Help others in understanding core concepts
* Plan, sketch, or otherwise draft general approaches (not full solutions)

#### Neighborhood assignments

For all neighborhood assignments, members will fill out a post-assignment assessment to determine individual level of effort (LoE).

* Contribute any and all ideas, even if you aren't sure it'll work or is correct
* Be respectful of other people's ideas and their misunderstandings
* Help where you can and be honest when you don't know what's going; it's very likely a peer can help you
  * If you exhaust peer assistance, it's certain that your neighborhood feels the way you do; this is the time to get the attention of the instructor and/or TLs
* Be nonjudgemental of others opinions
  * Often, the idea that feels the most radical can (at the very least) pivot your thinking toward a correct line of inquiry

* _Do_ assist others in your neighborhood, but _may not type directly on their keyboards_
  * _Do Not_ do this: if noticed repeatedly, this behavior may cause their neighborhood to lose neighborhood course points
* _Do_ use resources like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
  * _Do Not_ copy/paste code directly from these resources; this, as many of you recognize, is a violation of the Honor Code

To the above behaviors, the following are acceptable ways to assist:

* Remind any individual of important commands 
* Remind any individual of the orders in which certain commands need to be given
* Watch any individual write code and help guide them, while still allowing room for the individual to think and figure out how to get around obstacles on their own

#### Individual (collaborative) assignments

While certain assignments should be achieved individually, they can be completed by collaboration. However, keep in mind that -- like "group" assigments, "collaborative" assignments:

* _Do_ assist others in your neighborhood, but _may not type directly on their keyboards_
  * _Do Not_ do this: if noticed repeatedly, this behavior may cause their neighborhood to lose neighborhood course points
* _Do_ use resources like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
  * _Do Not_ copy/paste code directly from these resources; this, as many of you recognize, is a violation of the Honor Code

### Technical Leaders

This course features the assistance of several peer educators that the department refers to as Technical Leaders (TLs). You should recognize these citizens as quasi-authorities in this course. While they don't make any kinds of grading decisions, they are all much smarter than the course instructor. They're also much cleverer.

These people are not course resources in the sense that they are inanimate machines (also unlike your charitable Mayor). You agree to:

* Treat them courteously and with respect
* Not make strict demands of them; their enagagement with the course is a privilege, not a right
* Recognize that their feedback won't give you the "answer"; like instruction in this course, they're excellent resources to help you _reason_
* Consider interaction with TLs should attain the same level as interaction with the instructor

In the event that a conflict arises with a TL, please message the course instructor. Know that any issues that TLs have with citizens _are reported to me_, and if we need to discuss your engagement with them, the instructor agrees to arbitrate the issue with fairness to all involved.

### The "Repair Rule" (i.e. Assignment Revision)

This rule only applies to assignments classified as "Incomplete" assignments and _not "Ignored" assignments.

* _Once_ during the semester, a citizen may open an Issue on a repository to which they'd like to submit missing work to regain credit for an assignment
  * This issue should indicate a citizen's interest in reclaiming credit for this assignment using the "Repair Rule"
* This "Repair" issue must fill out the resulting form completely to request the ability to submit revisions
* Citizens submitting a revision must remedy deficiencies listed in the most recent "Checkpoint" issue
  * Credit will be awarded as "complete" or "incomplete" according to the guidelines outlined in the [Grading](#Grading) section above
* A citizen submitting a revision is allowed five (5) days to submit updated work
  * There is no limit on the number of `commit`s allowed during this time (i.e. citizens may `commit` as many times as they like)
