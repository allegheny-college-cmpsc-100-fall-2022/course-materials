# CMPSC 100: Course Contract

## A word from the Mayor

> In most learning situations in life outside of school, grades are never given. The learning that occurs in cooking, dance, or yoga studios do not use any grading. Why? In these “studio” cases, it seems meaningless to give students grades, and yet without any grades, those students get better at yoga, dance, and cooking.
>
> Asao Inoue, "160W's Grading Contract"

(Computer science has more in common with things like cooking or dance than you might think.)

Nearly everything you've done during your time at various learning institutions has resolved to single point: the final grade. Whether this was a quarterly, annual, or semi-annual grade (i.e. semester grade), your education has formatted you towards achieving the best letter grade outcome possible. That's not (mostly) how this course goes, however.

I recognize there as many reasons for taking this particular course as there are students enrolled in it. There exist an equal number of hesitancies and anxieties about this course as well. Some of you look forward to doing things simply because they are hard. Others of you may have enrolled in this class because it seems advantageous to develop skills tangent to computer science. Others may be interested in majoring in the discipline at Allegheny. 

One thing is likely common to all of you: you're at least somewhat afraid that this course will be difficult and that this difficulty will manifest itself in a poor grade.

This introduction is meant to allay that fear. I write above that this course will "mostly" not be contingent on grades. In fact, I want you to exile the idea of grading from your brain completely. The idea of failure often precludes us from taking risks for fear that we'll look or feel inferior or, at worst, be incapable of understanding a concept. Unfortunately, the inevitability of letter grades often amplifies that fear, as it's a very real consequence.

But this course is less about "making the grade" than it is giving you mental and computational skills and tools to conquer problems. In this way, I hope that you'll take less about the physical machinery of computers from this class and more of the -- dare I say "spiritual" -- exercise of approaching problem solving with new computational powers and applying ways of thinking to at least formulate ways to solve abstract quandries.

In fact, I care more about your excitement and confidence with the material than I do about grades. Grades are the _worst_.

This module -- at least up to the point where the college requires that I assign you an individual letter grade -- is _ungraded_, meaning you will never see an actual letter grade from me on an assignment. Instead, I will provide formative feedback. Does that mean you can't get anything _wrong_? No, of course not. You'll still have plenty of opportunity and encouragement to fail. All this means is that `failure != "F"`. (If you can read that last "equation," you've figured out some computational already.) The only thing that leads to failure here is inauthentic effort.

At the end of the module, I have to give you a grade. But, following this contract should take care of that.

In this course, we will rely on a contract to determine what kinds of behaviors lead to learning vis-a-vis a computer science environment. We will spend the opening class sessions of this course working together to identify and codify those things that we will hold ourselves and others accountable to. In fact, this class relies on more than just a sense of community to function: it relies on actual community rules and efforts. I include myself as part of this course community, so this contract also indemnifies _me and the course Technical Leaders (TLs)_ to uphold the behaviors and expectations written into it.

So what does all this mean? Perhaps it's important to identify what it _doesn't mean_: this course is not one where you will be able to just "get by." In fact, ungraded contract courses, historically, require _more_ work than graded ones. However, you are rewarded for completing work to a satisfactory degree, a statement which we will use this contract to clarify.

Here, you are rewarded for the quality of your honest work. Not everyone in computer science "got it" right away and I'm sure that your Technical Leaders (TLs) and even department faculty (including me) would tell you that. However, if you participate in this discipline, you'll learn that you're really developing a _practice_ -- a work that presages attempt, failure, _and_ success all at once -- in learning how to compute meaningfully. 

For all of you, the terrain of this journey will be tough in different ways. It's my sincere hope that spelling out the boundaries of the map will make it at least traversable.

## Contract stipulations

### The "Basic Grade"

* All students who meet the covenants of this contract will earn an individual letter grade of `C` in this course



### The "Rules Rule"

* Convenants in this contract may be changed following an open course discussion about the proposed change(s)
* Any changes will then be put to a vote. If a vote succeeds with a majority (50% + 1) outcome supporting the measure(s) proposed, the change will be made 

  * This applies to all portions of the contract _except_ for the "Basic Grade" and this rule ("Rules Rule")
  * In addition, the professor reserves the right to veto a proposed change if it demonstrably undermines the academic integrity of the course or is superceded by policies within the college's academic standards or handbook

### Participation

For the duration of this course, take "participation" to mean:

* helping in group activities
* completing assignments
* Listens to class instruction
* Giving full effort to class activities
* Actively contributing to collaborative assignments
* Being prepared for class by completing work outside of class hours
* For group assignments, each member of the group should appear in the "Contributors" list
* Respect neighborhood members' working hours
  * If a member prefers not to work past 9:00p, recognize that their participation and time may be limited to a certain window each day and that this window may not always be the same
  * However, make your best effort to be available to peers in your neighborhood rather than setting extremely restrictive hours

Please note that none of the above definitions _requires verbal contribution_ -- while this is a _way_ to participate, it is not the _only_ way. Activity on GitHub may also constitute full participation, if efforts display the above qualities. Occasionally, for group assignments, your neighborhood may receive a level of effort survey to gauge peer appraisal of team contribution as well.

As several of you note in your suggestions for this contract, it is good practice to consider your participation not only necessary for _your own success_, but _required for the success of your neighborhood as a whole_.

#### Course platforms

On course platforms used for the duration of the Module:

* Either install or remain logged in to all of the platforms needed for this class
* Use all the platforms for appropiate class reasons 
* Follow the instructions while using the platforms
* Keeping "up-to-date" with platforms may require seeking additional extra-curricular knowledge
  * For example, using Markdown in Discord
* Respect others' thoughts, time, and contributions to either discussion or code product
* Check course platforms often -- at least twice a day
  * The best times to review are often the beginning and ends of a day
    * i.e.: 8:00 (beginning), 18:00 (end)

In addition, I suggest that you at least download and install the Discord application, rather than use the web interface. This is not required, but will help greatly with your ability to keep up with notifications.

#### Using office hours

When using office hours:

* Come in prepared with questions, a topic, or a clear objective
  * To achieve this, please add notes about expected topic(s) to a Google Calendar slot reservation (for instructor calendar)
* Be prepared to recieve feedback, understanding that typically this means completing revisions on what ever you are working on
* Respect the time of other students (i.e. be mannerly and quick)
* Have all assignments ready to discuss with the Professor
* Not rely only on office hours (i.e. work should be attempted first)
 
#### Attendance

Especially in precarious times like those in which we find ourselves, I _cannot_ and _will not_ require you to be physically present for class sessions. However, if you feel well and comfortable, I (and your peers) ask that you attend class.

As many of your note, this isn't something that I provide grading criteria for. I don't really have an interest in directly grading attendance. However, _not attending_ traditionally shows up in final products and, thereby, grades. It's important to remember that attendance and participation are closely related. Not doing either severely restricts your ability to succeed in the course.

It is, however, also possible that a student many not feel well enough to attend even a portion of a remote course. In these situations, students must:

* Use their neighborhood as a source of knowledge for given content missed
* Failing the neighborhood's ability to "crowd-source" an answer, students should [use office hours](#Using-office-hours) to make up the gap in understanding
  * These hours _must be_ with the Instructor, and not a TL if intending to "catch up" on missed work
  * Students who have missed a class may use TL office hour time to if they feel that they understand the content, but have questions about approach or methods

### Assignments

* Assignments will be given for the week during the first course session of the week
* Assignments will be due on the following Sunday at 11:59p
* Due to the brief nature of this course, the instructor will not accept late assignments
  * Here, "late" should mean that an assignment is submitted more than 12 hours after the deadline

#### Unfinished work

In this course there are two types of unfinished assignments:

1. Weekly assignment repositories submitted missing some (not all) work ("Missing" assignments)
2. Entire weekly assignment repositories not submitted ("Ignored" assignments)

##### "Missing" assignments

* Any "Missing" assignments will count for half a letter grade against a student's final course grade

##### "Ignored" assignments

* Any "Ignored" assignments automatically constitute a failing grade in the course

#### Evaluation

Below, the term "run" should be taken to mean that the program executes without error.

##### Complete assignments

* Assignments will be graded on a _completion_ basis
  * Here, "completion" means:
    * Submission is made on or before due date/time
    * Submission features working code and/or complete documentation
      * Here, "working" should be taken to mean "run" -- programs can still produce incorrect results, but must _run_
      * Documentation also encompasses reflective writing
    * At least 80% of all grading "checks" satisfied
    
##### Incomplete assignments

* Turning in _incomplete_ work will count as a ["Missing" assignment](#Missing-assignments)
   * "Incomplete" should be taken to mean:
     * Submission not made on or before due date/time
     * Submission does not feature "working" code and/or has incomplete documentation
       * Here, "does not feature 'working' code" indicates the programs _don't run_
       
##### Assignment bugs and impact on grading

* In the event that there are "bugs" with grader criteria, the instructor will assess completion status with known issues in mind
  * The instructor will make every effort to remedy the failiing check before the assignment due date
  * However, if during assignment evaluation, a check fails for every student due to a technical issue, the check is considered an invalid grading criteria   

### Neighborhood contributions

This course works due to the trust the Mayor places in each neighborhood becoming a collaborative home for all students. However, there is a fine line between collaboration and academic dishonesty. Here, we define that that line is and what general consequences (positive or negative) are under it.

As a rule, some assignments are _group assignments_, and expect a single neighborhood-built product. This is both collaborative and co-creative. 

Every assignment, however, is collaborative, meaning that you have unlimited access to the members of your neighborhood for insight and advice.

Both of the above assignment types operate on the assumption that members, instead of just sharing code and working solutions:

* Share tips and tricks
* Help others in understanding core concepts
* Plan, sketch, or otherwise draft general approaches (not full solutions)

#### Neighborhood assignments

For all neighborhood assignments, members will fill out a post-assignment assessment to determine individual level of effort (LoE).

* Contribute any and all ideas, even if you aren't sure it'll work or is correct
* Be respectful of other people's ideas and their misunderstandings
* Help where you can and be honest when you don't know what's going; it's very like a peer can help you
  * If you exhaust peer assistance, it's certain that your neighborhood feels the way you do; this is the time to get the attention of the instructor and/or TLs
* Be nonjudgemental of others opinions
  * Often, the idea that feels the most radical can (at the very least) pivot your thinking toward a correct line of inquiry

* _Do_ assist others in your neighborhood, but _may not type directly on their keyboards_
  * _Do Not_ do this: if noticed repeatedly, this behavior may cause their neighborhood to lose neighborhood course points
* _Do_ use resources like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
  * _Do Not_ copy/paste code directly from these resources; this, as many of you recognize, is a violation of the Honor Code

To the above behaviors, the following are acceptable ways to assist:

* Remind any individual of important commands 
* Remind any individual of the orders in which certain commands need to be given
* Watch any individual write code and help guide them, while still allowing room for the individual to think and figure out how to get around obstacles on their own

#### Individual (collaborative) assignments

While certain assignments should be achieved individually, they can be completed by collaboration. However, keep in mind that -- like "group" assigments, "collaborative" assignments:

* _Do_ assist others in your neighborhood, but _may not type directly on their keyboards_
  * _Do Not_ do this: if noticed repeatedly, this behavior may cause their neighborhood to lose neighborhood course points
* _Do_ use resources like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
  * _Do Not_ copy/paste code directly from these resources; this, as many of you recognize, is a violation of the Honor Code

### Technical Leaders

This course features the assistance of several peer educators that the department refers to as Technical Leaders (TLs). You should recognize these students as quasi-authorities in this course. While they don't make any kinds of grading decisions, they are all much smarter than the course instructor. They're also much cleverer.

These people are not course resources in the sense that they are inanimate machines (also unlike your instructor). You agree to:

* Treat them courteously and with respect
* Not make strict demands of them; their enagagement with the course is a privilege, not a right
* Recognize that their feedback won't give you the "answer"; like instruction in this course, they're excellent resources to help you _reason_
* Consider interaction with TLs should attain the same level as interaction with the instructor

In the event that a conflict arises with a TL, please message the course instructor. Know that any issues that TLs have with students _are reported to me_, and if we need to discuss your engagement with them, the instructor agrees to arbitrate the issue with fairness to all involved.

### The "Repair Rule" (i.e. Assignment Revision)

This rule only applies to assignments classified as ["Missing" assignments](#Missing-assignments).

* _Once_ during the Module, a student may open an Issue on a repository to which they'd like to submit missing work to regain credit for an assignment
  * This issue should indicate a student's interest in reclaiming credit for this assignment using the "Repair Rule"
* This "Repair" issue must fill out the resulting form completely to request the ability to submit revisions
* Students submitting a revision must remedy deficiencies listed in the most recent "Checkpoint" issue
  * Credit will be awarded as "complete" or "incomplete" according to the guidelines outlined in the [Grading](#Grading) section above
* A student submitting a revision is allowed five (5) days to submit updated work
  * There is no limit on the number of `commit`s allowed during this time (i.e. students may `commit` as many times as they like)
