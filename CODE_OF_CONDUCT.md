# CMPSC 100: Course Contract

## A word from the Mayor

We're building a world. That task shouldn't be taken on as a solitary or light burden. In many ways, the product of such an endeavor always means to be imperfect; we learn more as we _do_, and that process is rarely (i.e. never) linear or "clean." We benefit from being able to be a bit messy. You may intuit from this statement that we mean to engage with _process_ much more than _product_, though the latter is necessary. Following the various processes of `term-world` closely should yield a successful product; however, production of output is only the _basic_ expectation of the work we'll complete together.

`TODO`: Review and ratify changes to the course contract on Friday.
